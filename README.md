# Auto Counter
## How to use?
1. Set the jumping **Frequency** of the counter, with the range from 1 to 100. Default value: 25.
2. Set the **Maximum** and **Minimum** values that the counter can obtain. The default values are 1000 and 0 respectively.
3. Click the **Start** button to make the counter run. At startup, it will be initialized to the minimum. When the value is higher than the maximum, it will be reset to the minimum.
4. Click the **Stop** button when you want to stop the counter. The value will remain at the lastest statement when it stops.
